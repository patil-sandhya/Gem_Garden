# Tech Stack Overview
## Frontend Technologies

### React.js

Our frontend is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture allows us to create modular and reusable UI components, making the development process efficient and maintainable.


### JavaScript (JS)

JavaScript is the foundation of our frontend development. It enables dynamic and interactive features on our website, ensuring a seamless and engaging user experience.

### CSS

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used to style and format our website's layout. CSS allows us to create visually appealing designs and responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

## Backend Technology

### RESTful API

Our backend relies on a RESTful API (Representational State Transfer) to handle data requests and interactions with the database. This API follows REST principles, providing a standardized and scalable approach to building web services. It enables communication between the frontend and backend, allowing users to browse products, manage accounts, view their cart, and place orders seamlessly.

## Additional Technologies

In addition to the core technologies mentioned above, we may use other tools and libraries to enhance the functionality and performance of our website. These may include:

### Authentication: 

For user authentication and security, we implement authentication mechanisms such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth.


### State Management:

Redux or Context API in React may be used for state management, ensuring efficient data sharing between components.

### Responsive Design: 

We follow responsive web design principles to ensure our website functions seamlessly on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.


### Deployment: 

Vercel used for deploying and hosting the frontend and for backend components we used Render.com .

Our tech stack is carefully chosen to provide a robust, scalable, and user-friendly experience for our customers while ensuring the security and integrity of their data.
